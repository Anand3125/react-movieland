#  Created a movie app front end in  React Js and intergrate this  with in  with OMDb movie app api.

Creating a movie web application using React and deploying it on Vercel involves several steps, encompassing both development and deployment phases...

1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Initialize a new React project using Create React App, which sets up the environment and provides a development server, Webpack configuration, and Babel presets. Install necessary dependencies like `react-dom` for react app and possibly libraries for svg image  like search svg or some API.

2. **API Integration:** Integrate a movie database API (The Movie Database API) to fetch movie information. This involves making HTTP requests using fetch API to retrieve movie details, search results, and categories.

3. **Building Components:** Create React components for different parts of the application, such as a search bar, movie list, movie card, and detailed view pages. Use state and effects hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage data fetching and state.

4. **Styling:** Style the components using CSS or CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components. Ensure responsiveness and an attractive user interface.

5. **Searching:** Implement searching with `search logo svg image` to search different names of movies, such as the Name of the movie, date of release, and images if available.

### Deployment on Vercel

1. **Vercel Setup:** Sign up or log in to Vercel. Connect your GitHub, GitLab, account to Vercel, allowing it to access your project repository.

2. **Project Configuration:** Import your project into Vercel by selecting the repository where your react-movieland app is stored. Configure build settings if necessary, though Vercel automatically detects and configures many projects.

3. **Deployment:** Deploy your application by pushing changes to your connected repository. Vercel automatically deploys new changes on push, providing a unique URL to access your live application.

4. **Live Update and Domain Configuration:** Once deployed, your app is live and accessible. We can configure a custom domain through Vercel's dashboard. Continuous deployment is supported, so every git push updates the live application.

This process results in a fully functional, publicly accessible movie web application built with React and hosted on Vercel, benefiting from Vercel's easy deployment, scalability, and out-of-the-box support for React applications.
